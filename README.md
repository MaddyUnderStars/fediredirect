# Fediredirect

open to name suggestions cause 'fediredirect' is used by literally everyone 

planned featureset:

- automatic redirection
- manual redirection for when ^ doesn't work or if you've disabled it for that instance
- support for mastodon, lemmy at least. hopefully also *key and/or akkoma
- erm, perhaps other things
